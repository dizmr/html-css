        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>In 1996, a New Jersey high school girls' soccer team travels to Seattle for a national tournament. While flying over Canada, their <b>plane crashes deep in the wilderness</b>, and the surviving team members are left stranded for nineteen months.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The series chronicles their attempts to stay alive as some of the team members are driven to <b>cannibalism</b>. It also on the lives of the survivors 25 years later in 2021, as the events of their ordeal continue to affect them many years after their rescue.</p>
        <h2>Favourite character</h2>
        <p>Natalie "Nat" Scatorccio is a character on the Showtime original series Yellowjackets. She is portrayed by <b>Sophie Thatcher</b> as a teenager and <b>Juliette Lewis</b> as an adult.</p>
        <div class="img">

        </div>
        <p>In high school, Natalie is frequently judged and harassed by her teammates due to her drug and alcohol abuse. She is best friends with Kevyn prior to the plane crash. After the plane crash, <b>Natalie and Travis prove to be the most proficient with the hunting rifle</b> and the two begin dating.</p>

        </div>
        <p> As an adult, she maintains a destructive on-and-off-again relationship with Travis but later breaks up with him. She returns to New Jersey after finishing a rehab program paid for by Taissa, but struggles to maintain sobriety and begins contemplating suicide after Travis's death.</p>
        <h2>General impressions</h2>
        <p>This is not exactly an easy show to review which might be part of the problem. Trying to compare it to other shows would be a mistake. It is alot like <b>"Lord of The Flies"</b> and <b>"Alive"</b> but with teenage girls. However that is just a simple explanation. Basically a successful girls soccer team crash lands in the remote wilderness and are forced to learn how to survive.</p>

        </div>
        <p>25 years later the trauma the survivors face is <b>still haunting them</b>. Part survival epic, part psychological horror and part coming-of-age drama. Its about not dealing with your past and what happens years later when it comes back to haunt you.</p>
